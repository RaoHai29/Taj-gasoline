    <br><br><br><br>
    <h1>ELECTRICAL SAFETY:</h1>
    <p>
      This section explains ways to reduce risk associated with working with electricity, one of the major site dangers.
      Making ensuring that the circuit is not overloaded and that working with electricity is done safely is crucial.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b> Working with electricity can cause:</b><br>
      - Electrocution due to contact with high currents<br>
      - Fire/explosion that may be caused for several reasons like overloading of circuits, shorts in wiring or
      the use of equipment in a hazardous area (Zone 0 & Zone 1).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In order to prevent these consequences, some basic barriers should be in place:<br>
      - When working on electrical equipment always switch off the power and make sure nobody can
      switch it on while work is being done by working with a special lock<br>
      - Avoid the use of extensions leads and junction boxes<br>
      - Check equipment at least annually and pay special attention to cords, plugs and connections<br>
      - Air conditioners, heaters and food equipment take a lot of power; ensure that the electrical circuit
      is not going to be overloaded. <br>
      - Details of the siteâs electrical system should be available, including circuit diagrams equipment and
      cable details, breaker sizes, panel details, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>CARD PAYMENT TERMINALS:</h1>
    <p>
      Portable credit/debit card terminals may be used on the forecourt by trained Staff Members provided suitable
      procedures are established and adopted that will prevent the terminals from being taken into the temporary
      hazardous areas that will arise during petrol dispensing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      - The procedure will include the Service Champions ensuring that there are no petrol spillages in the
      area and that fuel is not being dispensed from any nozzles within 0.5 meters of where the terminal is
      to be used.<br>
      - Do not conduct following activities in Hazardous Zone 0 & 1
      Charging of Handheld Terminals
      Connect or Disconnect power plug of Handheld Terminals
      Open or Separate Battery Packs<br>
      - Customers should be inside the vehicle when the transaction is being processed.<br>
      - Staff should not process the transaction and intervene if the customer is not observing our
      forecourt safety pillars. [Engine on, Smoking, Biker Straddling, Unauthorized Container, Mobile Phone]<br>
      - Staff should stand at the safe position, and should pay attention to the moving vehicles when they
      are walking at the forecourt.<br>
      - Staff should be wary that the handheld terminal might fall and cause spark and/or injury on the foot<br>
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h1>VISITOR MANAGEMENT:</h1>
    <p>

      - First aider is available<br>
      - Ensure mobile phones are submitted in the office before going to Hazardous Zone 0 & 1<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>SLIPS AND TRIPS:</h1>
    <p>
      Slips & Trips are the main reason for smaller incidents requiring medical treatment. To prevent them, the Site
      Staff should be aware of the following guidelines:

      - Pay attention to uneven surfaces and fix them as soon as possible<br>
      - Wear appropriate shoes especially while working at height (Tank Lorry Dip, etc)<br>
      - Avoid empty boxes and packaging on the floor especially in the storage rooms<br>
      - Keep walking on paths free of obstacles<br>
      - Mark or barricade risk areas with signs or cones as appropriate.<br>

    <h1>
      WORKING AT HEIGHT:
    </h1>
    <p>
      Working at height (above 1.8 meters) has caused a lot of incidents and also some fatalities. As a result, the site
      staff should not work at heights above 1.8 meters (6 feet). If it is not possible to eliminate working at a height
      above 1.8 meters, the following guidelines should be complied with:
    </p>
    <p>
      - Working from stand-alone ladders is not allowed for all activities occurring at Taj Gasoline Retail
      locations.<br>
      - A-frame or multi-purpose ladders may be used as a last resort provided; they are stable. Stability can
      be achieved by using the ladder on a level surface, having a second person foot the ladder or by
      securing the ladder to a fixed thing<br>
      - It is essential that the workers performing the work assess the risk at each occasion to ensure that
      the choice of working at height equipment is suitable for the task at hand.<br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The following guidelines should be complied with regardless
      of which height Site Staff are working:</h3>
    <p>
      - Steps and ladders must be in good condition, i.e., no broken or bent steps or beams and proper
      anti-slip feet<br>
      - Place steps and ladders on a non-slippery, stable surface<br>
      - Make sure the working area is barricaded<br>
      - Ensure you donât place steps and ladders in front of doors, unless they are locked<br>
      - When on a step or ladder never stretch your arms or legs to grasp an object<br>
      - If you need to use a high ladder, ask for help (a second person to hold the stairâs base)<br>
      - Do not lift heavy boxes from a ladder. Make sure all heavy boxes are stored on the ground or at
      a lower height<br>
      - Make sure storage racks are fixed to the walls so they canât fall if ladders are put against it<br>
      - Use an appropriate ladder. Never use chairs, boxes or anything not suitable to climb on.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>SPILL KIT:</h3>
    <p>
      Retailers to ensure that material for absorbing spills is present on site, this should be contained in a site
      spill kit. In case a spill occurs, it should be immediately contained & cleaned using the spill kit.<br><br>

      Following are the items:<br><br>

      Sand 200kg<br>
      Absorbents<br>
      Brooms<br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>CCTV:</h1>
    <p>
      Closed circuit TV Cameras must be installed on sites to control various areas of the site (inside and outside the
      building). CCTV Footage becomes critical in investigation in case of an incident. <br> <br>

      <b>Key guidelines:</b> <br> <br>

      - CCTV Cameras must be regularly cleaned <br>
      - Minimum 14 days of backup data must be stored at all times <br>
      - Remote monitoring through internet must be available <br>
      - CCTV power switch should be installed in a hidden location and access limited only to
      Retailer & Site Manager <br>
      - NVR and recording devices should be locked and access limited only to Retailer & Site Manager <br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>SAFES / UNDER FLOOR SAFES (STORE SALES AREA)</h3>
    <p>
      All Retail Stations must be equipped with Underground Safe.<br>
      - Underground safe must be located in a cash room with controlled access<br>
      - Cash Room entry must be monitored by CCTV Camera<br>
      - Cash Room must have a strong metal door and lock and no windows<br>
      - Drop chute must be available outside the cash room for Cashiers to drop cash into the safe
      without opening the cash room<br>
      - Underground safe must be operated only with two separate keys
      One key should be available on site
      One key should be available off site only
      One key should be available with Cashier and one key with Site Manager. No other person
      is authorized to retain Safe key.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      To manage sites with under floor safes:<br>
      - The Cash Room must be secured at all times<br>
      - To reduce the impact on customers, the safe should be emptied during quiet periods.<br>
      - All Cash Counting must be done within the Cash Room while it is locked<br>
      - Safe key should not be left inside the Site Office, drawers, etc<br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>MANAGING CASH SECURITY ON SITE
      (TILL LIMITS, ETC)
    </h1>
    <p>
      We must implement and adhere to a highly tight Cash Management Procedure to ensure that thieves won't steal large
      sums of money and that a robbery is not profitable. The aim of this section is to reduce âAttractivenessâ of the
      Retail Station to potential robbers.<br><br>

      Retailer & Site Manager should monitor this by conducting spot checks on Staff during a Shift to ensure that till
      limitations and forecourt cash restrictions (for attended serve locations) are properly adhered to.<br>
      Some specific guidelines are:<br>
      Make frequent deposits to the drop-safe facility throughout a shift period.<br>
      Ensure the cashier cabin is inaccessible by customer during a drop safe.<br>
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="./images/c8-12.PNG" class="di-2">
    </center>
    <p>
      - Make sure the office & cash room is locked whenever a Cash in Transit (CIT) company counts
      & collects the money<br>
      - Keep the cash drawer closed after each transaction<br>
      - Make sure high value items (watches, keys, phones, wallets, money) are not in sight of customers<br>
      - Never count money in front of customers before a drop safe.<br>
      - Cash limit for diesel cashier is PKR 100,000/- (Excess should be immediately deposited).<br>
      - Petrol limit for cashier is PKR 15,000/- (Cash should not be displayed in hand and kept in secure pouch)<br>
    </p>

      MANAGING CASH SECURITY DURING
      BANK TRANSFER

    </h1>
    <p>
      To make sure the Retailer or Site Manager are not robbed whilst they are bringing money to the bank, it is
      mandatory to hire a Cash in Transit company to collect to money at the site and take it to the bank.<br>
      Cash in Safe & Cash in Transit insurance is also recommended.<br><br>

      Some important guidelines on Cash Collection:<br>

    <h1>CRITICAL SECURITY THREATS AND
      HOW TO RESPOND?
    </h1>
    <h3>ROBBERIES:</h3>
    <p> Despite security procedures and precautions taken, the retail site can still be robbed. Therefore, we need to
      make
      sure Site Staff are trained on how to prevent a robbery, what to do during a robbery and what to do after a
      robbery.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">
      There is one Golden Rule: Give the money to any robbers and donât be a hero. The safety and security of Staff is
      more important than the money.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>HOW TO PREVENT A ROBBERY:</h3>
    <p>
      - Site Staff who are alert and standing attentive facing the site entrance can often deter criminal activity
      e.g., robberies. Always keep active and alert even when there are no customers.<br>
      - Make sure the robber canât see what is in the till. Follow the Cash Management guidelines
      - Scan the inside and outside of the premises and CCTV frequently.<br>
      - Watch for strangers loitering on or around the premises or sitting in parked vehicles. Let them be
      aware that they have been noticed.<br>
      - Should any member of staff have reasonable doubts about a personâs intentions, the door to the
      Cashier Cabin should be locked.<br>
      - By welcoming every customer to the site, you have an opportunity to see and recognize potential robbers<br>
      - Never allow unauthorized people into the Cashier Cabin or Site Office. Any person who requests
      access to staff areas, console area/office, must be asked for valid identification.<br>
      - Doors Cashier Cabin and Office Area should be closed and locked at all times to avoid
      unauthorized people from entering<br>
      - Do not give out information over the telephone. Never talk about security facilities or procedures
      to other people<br>
    </p>

    <h3>WHAT TO DO DURING A ROBBERY?</h3>
    <p>
      - Follow the instructions given by the robber<br>
      - Do not resist the robber<br>
      - Show your hands and make no unexpected movements<br>
      - Donât look in the eyes of the robber<br>
      - Raise alarm only after the robbers are gone and donât chase the robber<br>
      - In case there are other people in the store or storage room, inform the robber. This is to avoid
      unexpected situations for the robber, which might trigger dangerous reactions.<br>
      - COPS [Calm, Obey, Picture & Safeguard] Principle is available in the associated document.<br>
    </p><br>
    <h3>WHAT TO DO AFTER A ROBBERY?</h3>
    <p>
      - Raise alarm through the system and by calling Police and after the robber has left<br>
      - Donât talk to the press and donât disclose the amount taken in the robbery<br>
      - Secure CCTV footage<br>
      - Donât touch anything or move objects till after Police investigation<br>
      - Try to write down a possible description of the robber(s).<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>BOMB THREATS</h1>
    <p>
      If you receive a bomb threat:<br>
      - Remain calm and polite.<br>
      - Listen without interrupting.<br>
      - Note the time, date and duration of call.<br>
      - Ask:<br>
      - Where is the bomb located?<br>
      - What does it look like?<br>
      - When is it timed to go off?<br>
      - Call the Police.<br>
      - Call your manager/supervisor.<br>
      - Evacuate and seal off the area.<br>
      - Inform the Taj Gasoline Area Manager.<br>
      - Do not touch anything.<br>
      - Never start looking for a possible bomb yourself. Leave it to the Police and those who understand
      these things to look after the search and to deal with any suspicious item which is found<br>
      - Always take a bomb threat seriously.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>AGGRESSION / ASSAULT:</h1>
    <p>
      This section deals with aggression, including assault, intimidation, vandalism, physical/bodily injuries, verbal
      acts of threatening behavior and attempts to cause injury.<br><br>

      This might be caused by circumstances beyond our control like private problems or alcohol and drug abuse but also
      circumstances experienced on site, like broken equipment, impolite treatment and even incorrect quantity or
      prices.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:</h3>
    <p>
      Site Staff must be trained regularly through role plays to always try to avoid further escalation as personal
      safety is import.<br><br>

      It is the responsibility of the Retailer & Site Manager to:<br>
      - Protect Site Staff<br>
      - Train Site Staff to protect themselves<br>
      - Ensure Site Staff know how to deal with aggression<br>
      - Give Site Staff attention and care after an incident.<br>

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>IF A CUSTOMER BECOMES AGGRESSIVE: </h3>
    <p>
      - Pay attention to your stance, donât appear aggressive yourself<br>
      - Show that you take the customer seriously and stay calm<br>
      - Let the customer tell his story even if it is in an impolite way<br>
      - Donât argue with an emotional customer. But donât hesitate to state that you donât like to be treated like this,
      with abusive language, show and tell the customer if his behavior is unacceptable. In such cases,
      stay calm but firm and if needed call the Retailer / Police<br>
      - Try to find a solution for the customer. The best is to give him options to choose from<br>
      - If you get in a repeating circle, you can consider stopping the conversation and asking a more senior
      person to call the customer later.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>COMMON THEFTS:</h1>
    <h3>TILL DIPPERS:</h3>
    <p>
      Till Dippers operate alone or in pairs and they try to divert employeeâs attention so they can take money from the
      cash register. They may do it in one of several ways:<br>
      - By deliberately dropping their change on the floor on your side of the counter, expecting you to pick it
      up while they or someone else empties the cash register of large bills<br>
      - By posing as individual customers, one may divert an employeeâs attention to another part of the outlet
      while the partner reaches in the cash register<br>
      - By using the phone or hanging around the cash area until an opportunity to grab the cash arises.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO PREVENT TILL DIPPING:
    </h3>
    <p>
      - Close the cash drawer or complete the transaction with additional change<br>
      - Be alert and do not turn your back on an ope<br>
    </p>
    <h3>CHANGE MANIPULATORS:</h3>
    <p>
      Change manipulators are those who insist they gave you a bill of a larger denomination. Prevent this by
      placing the customerâs money on the cash register ledge before giving change or verbally announce the amount
      recieved.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      MARKED BILL PASSERS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      This routine normally involves two people. The first one pays with a larger bill with a distinctive marking on it.
      The accomplice then pays with a smaller bill, then insists the change is not correct and recalls the marking on
      the larger bill. To prevent this use the same method to prevent change manipulation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>SHORT CHANGERS:</h3>
    <p>
      Short change artists usually work by getting your money and theirs in their hands at the same time. Prevent this
      by having the customerâs money before giving out any from the cash register. Never allow someone to have the
      outletâs money and their own at the same time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      OVER THE COUNTER ROBBERY:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Over the counter robberies can be carried out by armed assailants who target cash-in- till, high value items or
      cigarettes (see section on Robberies).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      DRIVE OFFS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A drive off is when a customer drives off the site without making a payment.<br><br>

      - Unfortunately, we have a number of customers that decide not to pay after re- fueling.<br>
      - Personal safety always comes first when dealing with drive offs.<br><br>

      NEVER TRY TO STOP A CAR OR PREVENT THE CUSTOMER FROM DRIVING AWAY BY BLOCKING THE CAR.<br><br>

      NEVER STAND IN FRONT OF A VEHICLE WHEN SOMEONE IS BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL.<br><br>

      Collect as much data as possible for instance license plate data, make and type of the car, details of the carâs
      occupants. If possible, secure CCTV footage.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>CREDIT / DEBIT CARD:</h2>
    <p>
      Use of debit, credit and fuel cards is increasing. Such increase in use also brings challenges for controls
      measures that are needed to prevent fraudulent activities. Retailer, manager and all concerned staff should always
      follow the standard guidelines for use of different cards in order to avoid any problem, especially any fraudulent
      activity.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="./images/c8-15.PNG" class="di-2">
    </center><br>
    <p>
      As we know from experience internal fraud happens from time to time. Retailers and Site Managers should be alert
      for this kind of theft. Since we sell many high value products in stock which are also very current, we expect
      controls to be in place.<br><br>

      We realize that due to the business model not only the Retailer is impacted but also Taj Gasoline. Discuss fraud
      with staff and make them aware of implications such as losing the job or being arrested and prosecuted by Police
      including being jailed.<br><br>

      Internal fraud may occur in following circumstances:<br>
      - Incorrect dip reading and shift closing<br>
      - Extraction of cash during the shift<br>
      - Incorrect dispensation of Staff Salaries<br>
      - Incorrect reporting of market rentals<br>
      - Unauthorized electricity connections from the Retail Station<br>
      - Incorrect dispensation of fuel<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>SKIMMING:</h2>
    <div style="display: flex;">
      <div style="flex: 40%; margin-top: 30px;">
        <p>
          A credit, debit or fuel card is skimmed or cloned when the information contained in the magnetic stripe is
          captured on a portable card swipe. This information is subsequently used to produce a duplicate or counterfeit
          card. Retail fuel outlets process millions of card transactions per month, many more than most other
          businesses.<br><br>

          Skimming no longer requires active cooperation of Service Champions handling the cards, it is also done on
          outdoor terminals where equipment to collect data is applied and picked up at a later stage.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          - Monitor sample of credit card transactions through CCTV footage<br>
          - Monitor Cashier Cabin, Staff area for skimming devices<br>
        </p>

    <h1>ENVIRONMENT:</h1>
    <p>
      It is important that we look after the environment. In particular, doing what we can to minimize the effects of
      any fuel spills and leakages, manage our waste to minimize the effects on the environment and to use energy
      efficiently.

    </p>
    <h3>
      FUEL SPILLS AND LEAKS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Spillage or leakage of fuel, particularly motor spirit creates a major hazard and must be prevented. In order to
      do so, carry out regular checks to ensure that equipment and premises are sound and comply with legal
      requirements.<br><br>

      These checks should include:<br>
      - Control of pipe connections, pump hoses and nozzles, equipment, machinery, tools and premises<br>
      - Applying site fuel handling procedures and wet stock control methods on a daily basis. For further
      information, refer to the Stock Reconciliation Section in Stock Management Chapter.<br>
      - Checking that fire-fighting equipment is in first class condition, appropriate to the specific site
      requirements and ensuring that regular fire drills and instructions are undertaken<br>
      - The Retailer must ensure there is a fully stocked first aid kit at site and that at least one member of staff,
      qualified in its use, is available at all times during operating hours<br>
      - Ensuring that material for absorbing spills is present on site<br>
      - If a spill or a suspected leakage does occur, emergency procedures must be put into immediate action.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      FUEL SPILLS AND LEAKS:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Power generation is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases that are causing global warming. Moreover, energy
      and other utility prices in Pakistan have increased significantly in recent years.<br><br>

      Retailer shall endeavor to operate the site with efficient use of utilities, in particular, electricity. The main
      sources of electricity consumption on a retail site are lighting, refrigeration, heating, ventilation and air
      conditioning (HVAC) equipment.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      - Use the energy management processes and checklists to record energy expenditure on your sites
      to identify and potentially decrease energy usage. Refer to Utilities section in KPIs Chapter for tools to
      monitor electricity consumption.<br><br>

      - Ensure that such features are operated to achieve their energy efficiency purpose, this includes the
      installation of LED lights where applicable.<br><br>

      - In all cases, the Retailer is responsible for creating staff awareness, installing site procedures where
      necessary, monitoring the energy efficiency of the site operations and intervening in cases of
      obvious inefficient practices<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>WASTE MANAGEMENT:</h3>
    <p>
      Waste management is important to keep station away from hazards. Following are some of the important things to do
      on daily or on need basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Dispose of waste from housekeeping.<br>
      - Dispose of flammable and combustible waste with all safety measures.<br>
      - Clear debris in form of solid and liquid wastes.<br>
      - Dispose of spill absorption material.<br>
      - Do away with expired or damaged stuff.<br>
      - Dispose of black oil and relevant filters from oil change area.<br>
      - If there is any valuable scrap to be kept at station for resell, store in in safe area and sell it
      off as soon as possible.<br>
      - Waste removal should not cause any damage to locality surrounding the station.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>
      EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
    </h1>
    <p>
      - All Site Staff must always have access to the Emergency Response Plan and are trained in emergency
      procedures before starting their shift<br>
      - They have a Site Drill Plan to exercise a Site Drill; 1 x per month minimum.<br>
      - All Site Staff should be trained prior to the drill and participate. For sites with CNG an extra drill should be
      organized to ensure Staff are aware of CNG related (ERP) requirements.<br>
      - Contact Details of Local Authorities like Police, Fire department, medical services, Bomb Squads must be
      maintained and visible to all Staff<br>
      - The first thing to remember during a security incident is to preserve life or avoid getting hurt.<br>
      - After an incident, the next thing to remember is to avoid further aggression and recover life, in case any
      was harmed during the security incident.<br>
      - In the preservation of life, the general rule is to avoid provocation of the suspect(s)/ assailant(s).<br>
      - On the other hand, in the recovery of life, one should immediately provide proper aid to the victim(s).<br>
      - Taj Gasoline is notified in case of an emergency immediately and in any event no later than
      24 hours after occurrence
