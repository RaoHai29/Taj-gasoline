        </p>
        <h3>ORGANOGRAM</h3>
        <h4>STATION ORGANOGRAM (STANDARDIZED):</h4>
        <p>A well defined organization structure with clear roles & responsibilities is the key to success of any business. This is all more important in our industry which has a high customer interface, multiple and recurring
            operational tasks, and high dependence on people. <br><br>
            
            Taj Gasoline has created a well-crafted Retail Station organization structure enables a high performing site team. This structure is variable depending on location, products being offered and facilities. The
            organization structure is the guiding principle defining the (OLE) (Optimum level of employment).

        <h1>RECRUITMENT</h1>
        <p>Recruitment is the process of actively seeking out & hiring candidate for a specific position. At Taj Gasoline, OLE (Optimum Level of Employment) set prior to launch of Taj Gasoline Retail Station will be the basis for recruitment. 
            Station will have staffing as per approved headcount as given in the OLE (Any deviation in headcount will be prior
             approved through respective Taj Gasoline Area Manager. All staffing requirement needs to consider the following:
        </p>
        <h3>Peak Hours:</h3> 
       <p>
        Peak hours can range from city to city and route to route, just as they might between different 
        products being supplied at a station. Adequate staff should be available to cater to Rush Hour demand. 
        There should not be any break (lunch, etc) in Rush Hour except Namaz Break. 
       </p>
       <h3>Top Seasons of business:</h3>
       
      <p>
        Due to accessibility in terms of commodities movement, there are several regions where summer are busier on the 
        highways than winter. Family travel is more common during summer vacations or in specific winter regions when 
        there is greater traffic. Whereas each area has its own agricultural seasons which will determine requirement 
        for additional staff. 
      </p>
      <h3> Unusual Absence of Staff:</h3>
     <p>
      Retail business has a very high turn-over. Typically, frequent leaves are experienced and need to be catered to.
     </p>
     <h3> Approved leaves:</h3>
     <p>
        Leaves such as pilgrimage, annual or any other event should be planned to ensure no gaps are there at forecourt or 
        dispensers which ensure smooth handling of customer flow with uninterrupted/delayed service. 
     </p>
     <h3>Shift Management: </h3>
     <p>
        It is used to manage different shift types and help the station create an easy-to-follow schedule for personnel 
        shifts. This is to guarantee that customers receive excellent service with a smile, which is only possible if 
        they are not worn out by arbitrary scheduling.
     </p>
     <h3> Placement of Skilled and experienced staff: </h3>
     <p>
        During interviews it is evident and can be judged by the Retailer/Taj Gasoline that a skilled staff can be better 
        accommodated where the load is predicted to be extensive resulting in better service. However, during training 
        further filtering of individuals based on their performance should be made.

<h1>SHIFT MANAGEMENT:</h1>
<p>
   In order to ensure that all the pieces of the puzzle are in place to enable seamless operational activity for a specified shift, shift management focuses on the large picture by putting all the daily activities of the Retail Station together. <br>
<br>
As the Retailer, you will utilize the resources and management skills to coordinate customer service excellence and operations across all areas as you align and engage the shift to run the day. It's crucial that Site Manager and the team communicates among themselves and the Retailer and Area Manager as all are linked with the common goal of service excellence with profitability. 
<br><br>
Site Manager is in charge of all shifts and the outcome of each shift both in terms of operational performance, customer service and revenue.  This can be only achieved by maintaining the standards set by Taj Gasoline and following through with Shift Management guidelines. 
<br><br>
Recommended Shift for Staff at Retail Station should not be greater than 12 Hours.<br> 
</p>
<center>
   <img class="di-1" src="./images/t-1.jpg">
</center>
<h1>ATTENDANCE:</h1>
<p>
   Ensuring complete staff attendance on time is very critical since our OLE is defined at optimal level to ensure right customer experience. Given this is a Retail business which is heavily dependent on staff, absence of even one staff member can severely hamper site operations. 
   <br><br>

Effective monitoring of the attendance is also important to ensure that payroll is processed accurately and there is no fraudulent activity which may impact your profitability. 
<br><br>

In order to do so it is mandatory for the Retailer to install the Electronic Attendance Machine (EAS) to ensure proper attendance is taken while entering & exiting the fuel station. Attendance machine is also recommended to avoid fraud at site in form of fake employees, resulting in excessive payroll cost. 
<br>
Attendance machine can be installed with the help of Taj  Gasoline IT team.
</p>
<h2>Attendance Machine:</h2>
<center>
   <img class="di-1-1" src="./images/t-2.jpg">
</center>
<p>
   If at all it is not possible for the Retailer to install the EAM, manual entry on the attendance register
    is mandatory to be maintained. <br>
It is mandatory for the Site Manager to submit the attendance to the Retailer by the 3rd of every month and should be 
reviewed through comments by the Retailer on email. Manual entries on register should be signed off by the Retailer. <br>

This should include All leaves, half days, absents may be registered on EAS and register also.<br>

<h1>
   DAILY WAGERS
</h1>
<p>
   Daily wagers are not recommended by Taj Gasoline given they are not trained resources and may impact customer experience 
   as well as pose a security risk. However, in extreme situations and in order to ensure business continuity, daily Wagers 
   may be hired for maximum of 2 days. 
</p>
<p>
   -   There is a high turnover in forecourt staff on all retail stations across the industry and Taj Gasoline is no exemption
      to this. In order to ensure that there is no impact on site operations, the site manager must maintain a record
      of daily wagers available in the area and those who are already trained. <br>
-   Site Manager should manage forecourts through daily wagers only in case of leaves/resign of
     permanent employee.<br>
-   Daily wagers must be utilized in basic activities such as wiper service, traffic management, water boy. 
-   In case a daily wager is appointed as attendant, site manager must impart training on customer service steps
     & HSSE before commencement of duty.<br>
-   It is to be ensured by the site manager to coach the daily wager at forecourt time to ensure optimum
     and standardize performance. <br>

<h1>PERSONAL HYGIENE:</h1>
<p>
   The cleanliness, demeanor, and behavior of employees are all examples of personal hygiene. For obvious reasons, employers may find that their employees' personal hygiene is a sensitive subject A formal policy makes things less awkward because staff members will know what is expected of them.
   <br><br>
We must maintain personal hygiene in all facets of daily life, from dawn to night, in order to safeguard our health. To stay healthy, one must regularly wash their clothes and clean their bodies, hair, mouths, and teeth. Personal cleanliness and health go hand in hand.
<br><br>
Since we frequently engage with customers who are also our guests in the industry we work in, initial impressions are crucial. Staff must maintain their own hygiene and the cleanliness of the premises to ensure a lasting impression on the customer. To keep the personnel and our valued customers safe and healthy, it is crucial to have warning signs posted in case of a pandemic and strict SOPs that must be followed in accordance with regulatory instructions.
<br><br>
Employees should be reminded of the need of maintaining good personal hygiene by explaining the situation to them, treating them with respect, and stressing the implications for interactions with clients and coworkers. Weekly reminders from the station manager are necessary to ensure that everyone on staff complies with the rules strictly. The Retailer/Site Manager must make sure the station manager complies with company policies because it immediately affects his business.
