          <h1 style="font-size: 38px;">WHAT IS CUSTOMER RELATIONS?</h1>
          <p style="width: 60%;">
            Customer relations refers to the methods, strategies, and processes
            a company uses to improve the customer experience on a short- and
            long-term basis. It’s the sum of all customer interactions and
            experiences. This may differ depending on the size of your business
            and the nature of customers.
            <br><br>
            Customer relations encompasses a wide variety of tasks. Take a look
            at some specific activities so you know where to start:
          </p>

          <p style="width: 70%; margin-top:-35px;">
            - Analysing customer feedback through surveys and customer service
            interactions<br>
            - Setting marketing strategies<br>
            - Working with IT and technical teams to streamline customer
            interactions and decrease wait times<br>
            - Building and maintaining brand credibility<br>
            - Ensuring the customer service experience is consistent across
            customer touchpoints<br>
            - Proposing solutions to frequent issues, bottlenecks, and <br>
          </p>

          style="margin-left: 40px; color:rgb(77, 74, 74); font-size:22px; font-weight:800;font-family: 'Maven Pro',sans-serif; margin-top:-25px;">CUSTOMER
          RELATIONS VS. CUSTOMER SERVICE:</h4>
        <p
          style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%; color:black;font-size:14px; font-family: 'Maven Pro',sans-serif; text-align:justify;">
          Customer relations and customer service share overlapping principles
          and sound like interchangeable terms, but
          they’re not quite the same thing. Customer service is usually reactive
          (helps customers in real-time), while
          customer relations is primarily proactive (strives to improve the
          customer experience and solve problems
          before they happen).

            than a Diesel Customer. Gup Shup
            (having conversation) is hence not mandatory. However, if an
            opportunity arises, ask the customer about their journey and thank
            them for choosing Taj Gasoline.

            Please be mindful of families in the vehicle. Be respectful while

        <p style="width: 90%;">
          Taj Ehsas is a 24/7 free helpline that is accessible to clients.
          Travelers in need can dial "0311-1111825," and their requests are
          forwarded to the appropriate station. The station manager must reply
          to requests immediately and provide all necessary assistance. <br><br>

          In order to advertise the service, a sticker is attached to each of
          the canopy column that houses the station where the dispenser is
          located and facing the canopy's exit. If there is just one column at
          the station, the sticker needs to be applied to both sides of the
          column so that each consumer can see the number at the dispenser's
          nozzle.

          MARKET FIELD VISIT:

        <p style="font-family: 'Maven Pro',sans-serif;width:90%;color:black;">
          Success story of Taj can easily be summed up to two things, customer
          engagement and customer satisfaction.
          Taj has been able to lead the market against competition in every
          trade area they stepped in and market
          visits is one the main foundational pillars of Taj on which this has
          been achieved.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Maven Pro',sans-serif;width:90%;color:black;">
          - Market visits are crucial to establish relationship with customer
          and share information on Taj services and facilities.<br>
          - Customers appreciate talking with a salesman who is not trying to
          sell goods, but instead someone who is invested in
          hearing about their problems and preferences.<br>
          - It creates a certain bond: Meeting customers in their environment
          shows you how they integrate with you.<br>
          - This engagement helps build customer trust on site and services, as
          well as helps us understand their business.<br>
          - It also helps identify customer needs or problems that are not
          easily observed in daily operations.<br>
          - It helps us understand the competition better, including analysis of
          their services, offers & facilities <br>
