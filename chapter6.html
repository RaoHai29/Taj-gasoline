<h1 style="font-size: 65px;">FUEL STOCK MANAGEMENT</h1>

<p>
    Reliability is one of the 4 Customer Promises of Taj Gasoline. This means providing<br>
    uninterrupted fuel supply to our customers on Taj Gasoline Retail Stations. Ensuring this<br>
    through planning, ordering, processing payment and receiving product is a daily activity which the Site Manager is primarily responsible for. 
</p>
<br>
<h2>CRITICAL STOCK PLANNING ACTIVITIES:</h2>
<center>
    <img class="di-1" src="./images/k-1.PNG" >
</center><br id="d2"><br><br><br>
<h1>ORDER PLANNING:</h1>
<p>
    Planning the right order is the first step to making sure the Retail Fuel Station has the right fuel quantity in storage tanks at all times. 
</p>
<h3>HOW TO PLAN FUEL ORDERS: </h3>
<p>
    Always ensure 3 day stock cover is available in tanks at the time of ordering. This is to ensure adequate stock is available in case of an unexpected demand spike or delay in supply. 
Review Daily Order Planning & UGT Tool on daily basis. <br><br>
Review for upcoming weekly holiday (Sunday) or any public holidays with no Fuel supply 
Review available ullage and lead time from depot to ensure the order will be decanted
immediately upon arrival of tank lorry.<br><br>
As a standard rule of thumb: place order for minimum 3 days sale when stock
levels reach 3 days. <br><br>
Decantation is a high risk activity, avoid small daily orders in order to minimize number of
deliveries at the Retail Station and maximize UGT Gain <br>

<h1>MANAGING UNDERGROUND TANK GAIN AND LOSs:</h1>
<p>
    Product gain is a significant part of Retail Station’s profitability.
    <br><br>
For a site situation on highway with high diesel sales, ~22% of Retail Station’s annual profitability should come from product gain in underground tanks.  For city sites with high Gasoline sales, ~10% of annual profitability should come from product gain. This is while retaining measurements completely accurate. 
<br><br>
As an high impact operational KPI, this must be monitored on daily basis to ensure this segment of site profitability is safeguarded while ensuring that we remain focused on our core values of Trust. 
</p>
<h3>DAILY STOCK RECONCILIATION:</h3>
<p>
    <b>
        Stock Reconciliation Formula is as follows:
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        1- Calculate Book Stock as per the formula below 
    </b>
</p>
<center>
    <img src="./images/n-7.PNG"  class="di-2">
</center>
<p>
    <b>
        2- Calculate Gain / Loss by comparing Book Stock vs Actual Stock in Hand (Dip) 
    </b>
</p>
<center>
    <img src="./images/n-8.PNG"  class="di-2">
</center>
<p>
    <b>
        3- Product tests like customer measurement check or dispenser measurement check should be
      recorded whenever conducted. 
    </b>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    a- If test litres are retuned to underground tank, those litres should be deducted from sales
      for accurate measurement of Gain / Loss
</p>
<p>
    Daily Stock Reconciliation Tool is included in detail in the Section on KPIs 
</p>
<center>
    <img src="./images/n-9.PNG"  class="di-3">
</center>
<h3 style="color: #ed1c24;">
    BEST PRACTICES FOR MAINTAINING UGT GAIN:
</h3>
<p id="d9">
    1-  Always depute a reliable and trust worthy team member to conduct shift closing and tank lorry decantation. <br>
2-  Follow all guidelines with respect to tank lorry decantation leveraging tools already provided such as dip
       book and TL Decantation Book. <br>
3-  Conduct daily tank wise stock reconciliations and review for anomalies <br>
4-  Conduct spot checks and mid day closing on random days throughout the month <br>
5-  Conduct monthly stock reconciliation yourself to see overall stock movement in the month <br>
6-  Ensure all dip measurement equipment including dip rod are in proper condition. <br>
7-  Ensure measurement is always accurate through customer measurement checks throughout the day. This
       helps build customer confidence as well as ensures oversight. <br>
8-  Regularly check pipelines, hoses, nozzles & other equipment for leakages <br>
</p>
<h3 style="color: #ed1c24;">
    FACTORS IMPACTING TANK GAIN / LOSS:
</h3>
<p>
    <b>
        Seasonality & Impact of Temperature Changes on Tank Behaviors:
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Please note that there is significant changes in gain / loss over the course of the year due to changes in
temperatures. While subsoil temperature inside the underground tanks remains consistent throughout the year, ambient temperatures vary significantly across all parts of the country, resulting in temperature variance. 
<br><br>
Following is the target gain / loss across the year based on our experience and average data of over 25 Retail Stations. <br>
<center>
    <img src="./images/n-10.jpg"  class="di-3">
</center>
<br><br>




<p style="color:black">
    In case the gain / loss is not being realized, detailed assessment is required to see what are the lapses
</p>

</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Tank Behaviors:
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Certain tanks may over time exhibit peculiar gain / loss behavior. This may include inconsistent behavior (exceptionally high gain or loss) when the tank is operating on either extremely low stock or extremely high stock. There may also be the case where the tank displays unusual gain or loss on the day deliveries are received, however, this should average out over the next few days. 
<br><br>
There may be multiple explanation for this including (1) settlement, (2) uneven tank installation or (3) uneven tank construction. 
<br><br>
While these issues cannot be avoided, they are expected to average out over a longer time period. It is important to understand how your station’s tanks behave at various dip levels.
</p>
<br>
<h3 style="color: #ed1c24;">
    WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF EXCESSIVE LOSS?
</h3>
<p>
    In case of excessive gain or loss, a detailed investigation is necessary to isolate the issue and then take necessary correction action.<br>
<b>Following steps should be followed: </b><br>
Ensure nozzle measurements are accurate  <br>
Conduct 3 hourly closing and reconciliation to isolate the time of day where the loss is coming from <br>
Conduct the Product Loss Investigation Process along with the Area Manager to identify if there are any issues in our procedures or hardware  <br>
In case the issue is not identified in either of these cases, kindly log complaint on Taj Ehsaas in order to conduct a detailed tank & pipeline testing <br>
