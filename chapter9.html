        <h1>DISPENSER:</h1>
        <h3>Main Principles of Dispenser Maintenance </h3>
        <p>
            Keep all functional units of the dispenser clean so that any potential unexpected defect may be easily
            identified and quickly removed.<br>
            Continuously check all connections if the leakage of the fuel occurs, tighten and reinforce joints.<br>
            Check and, if necessary, correct tensioning of the V‐belt with the engine bracket.<br>
            Check and, if necessary, tighten the screws that secure the electric motor to the bracket.<br>
            Inspect the condition of the delivery nozzle and decide on repair or replacement of the delivery nozzle, if
            necessary, according to the type and size of the defect.<br>
            Regularly check the condition of the delivery hoses. In case of mechanical damage to the delivery hose,
            ensure its immediate replacement.<br>
            Check the function of the door locks and the mechanism for hanging the delivery nozzle.<br>
            Care for external cleanliness of the dispenser, pay special attention to counter window cleanliness.<br>
            Regularly carry out sludge, water and other impurities removal by using a sludge pump from
            tanks (fuel tanks).<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b style="color: red;">Caution:</b> It is necessary to always switch off electricity and take reliable
            measures against its reconnection before performing all maintenance work
            at mechanical, hydraulic or electrical parts.<br>
            <b style="color: red;">Caution:</b> Do not open the distribution box lid if the dispenser is live.

        <h3>WARNING:</h3>
        <p>
            Dispensers are hygienically harmless for the customer and operator. It is advisable to protect your hands,
            For example, with eco‐friendly gloves during normal maintenance and during deliveries. In case of skin
            contact, wash the affected area as soon as possible with soap and water. In case of eye contact, etc., seek
            medical attention. During. Deliveries, avoid inhalation of vapors of the pumped medium.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>CAUTION:</h3>
        <p>
            - It is forbidden to smoke and use open fire in the immediate vicinity of the dispenser.<br>
            - The smoking ban applies also to passengers inside the vehicle.<br>
            - It is forbidden to use mobile phones in the immediate vicinity of the dispenser.<br>
            - It is forbidden to pump into the vehicle tank while the engine is running.<br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>TROUBLESHOOTING:</h1>
        <p>
            When you encounter a problem, first read the below mentioned points where the most frequently asked
            questions of the dispenser users about the problems encountered at the fuel station are described.
            In the event of a dispenser defect, the electronic counter that controls the dispenser displays a fault
            message in the form of a numeric code. <br> <br>

            <b>The dispenser does not respond to the removal of the delivery nozzle and there is no fault message on the
                display</b> <br> <br>

            This means that the dispenser is without the power supply, or the delivery nozzle on the dispenser is poorly
            hinged, or that the dispenser is blocked by the control system. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            -Check proper hanging of all delivery nozzles<br>
            -Check whether pumping made on the dispenser is paid at the cash desk.<br>
            - If the dispenser is in manual mode, try unlock the dispenser with the IR remote controller (press the
            "0").<br>
            - Turn the power supply of dispenser counter off and on.<br>
            - Check the power supply of dispenser, i.e. when the power is turned on the display must pass the test.<br>
            -Check the position of the circuit‐breaker for the single‐phase power supply 230V of the dispenser in the
            main switchboard of the fuel station.<br>
            - If the dispenser is connected to the control computer, the dispenser blocking may be coupled to a control
            system that does not release the dispenser for pumping or blocks the dispenser. Turn the power dispenser off
            and on and change the dispenser mode from automatic to manual. If the stand is in a manual mode, there is a
            fault on the control computer side.<br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>When the delivery nozzle is lifted, the display is reset but the pump does not start </h5>
        <p>
            This means that the dispenser electric motor has not been started. The cause may be the power supply circuit
            breaker that is located in the main switchboard or the electrical motor protection disconnected inside the
            dispenser.<br>
            Check the position of the circuit breaker of three‐phase supply of the dispenser motors in the main
            switchboard of the fuel station.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>An error message "E18” will appear on the display of the dispenser </h5>
        <p>
            This is a dispenser fault message that indicates that communication between the dispenser and the control
            unit (computer, station controller, control console, etc.) has been lost. <br>
            - Check the correct operation of the control unit (turning on the counter, turning on the data converter).
            <br>
            - Check the data cable connection. <br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
            At the beginning of the delivery, the customer removes the delivery nozzle and does not deliver (e.g.,
            because of opening the fuel tank of the car). After a while the pump turns off. The display shows "STOP”.
        </h5>
        <p>
            This is a dispenser report that states that the delivery has been terminated due to interrupting the
            delivery for longer than 60 seconds. Hang the delivery nozzle and re‐deliver.
        </p>
        <h5>
            After picking up the delivery nozzle an error message "E30" appears on the display of the dispenser .
        </h5>
        <p>
            This is a fuel dispenser failure report that states that the fuel unit price is zero.<br>
            If the rack is operating in a manual mode without the remote control, then the unit price is incorrectly
            set. Set the fuel unit price.<br>
            If the dispenser is controlled remotely, then check the fuel unit price settings in the station controller
            (computer, controller). Before each delivery, the fuel price is automatically sent to the dispenser.<br>

            Maintenance Tips for Successful Operation:
        </h5>
        <p>
            - It is important that during initial start-up and periodically during operation, routine verifications and
            checks are performed.<br>
            - Keep the chiller in clean and ventilated place. There should not be any dust and other contaminants which
            may block the condenser unit.<br>
            - Do not adjust/ tamper any of the components in the chiller. They are factory set and should be
            - adjusted only by the authorized service persons.<br>
            - Do provide a stabilizer if your voltage fluctuates too much.<br>
            - Routinely inspect for refrigerant leaks.<br>
            - Check compressor operating pressure & oil level.<br>
            - Check all electrical starters, contactor and relays.<br>
            - Pump motor should be checked regularly for plugged air inlets, leading to overheating.<br>
            - Chiller and water tank should be clean. Tank may have to be drained periodically to replace system water
            and
            clean debris from tank. Dirty water can cause excessive plugging of heat exchangers and pump seal wear.<br>
            - If the machine has lost refrigerant, it is necessary to first find the causes before carrying out any
            replenishment operation. The leak must be found and repaired.<br>
            - Searching with soap/water solution is a good method and simple methos for medium to large leaks, while an
            electronic leak detector is required to find small leaks.<br>
            - Add refrigerant to the system through the service valve located on the suction pipe.<br>

        </p>
        <h5>
            Preventive Maintenance:
        </h5>
        <p>
            Once your portable chiller has been placed into service, the following maintenance procedures should be
            adhered to as closely as possible. The importance of a properly established preventive maintenance program
            cannot be overemphasized. Taking the time to follow these simple
            procedures will result in substantially reduced downtime, reduced repair costs, and an extended useful
            lifetime for the chiller. Any monetary costs of implementing these procedures will almost
            always be more than pay for it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
            Once a Week:
        </h5>
        <p>
            (Air-Cooled Units Only) Check the surface of the air-cooled condenser coil for dirt and debris. To clean,
            rinse thoroughly with water. Mild detergent can be used to remove smoke and or grease stains.<br>
            Check to make sure that the To Process temperature is maintained reasonably close to 26 the Set Point
            temperature. If the temperature stays more than 5°F away from the set point, there may be a problem with the
            chiller. If this is the case, refer to the Troubleshooting Chart or contact the Customer Service
            Department<br>
            Check the pump discharge pressure on the gauge on the back panel of the chiller. Investigate further if the
            pressure starts to stray away from the normal operating pressure.<br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
            Once a month:
        </h5>
        <p>
            - With the main disconnect shut off and locked out, check the condition of electrical connections at all
            - contactors, starters and controls. Check for loose or frayed wires.<br>
            - Check the incoming voltage to make sure it is within 10% of the design voltage for the chiller.<br>
            - Check the amp draws to each leg of the compressor (fans or blowers on air-cooled units) and pump to
            confirm
            that they are drawing the proper current. Every Three Months<br>
            - Units are equipped with a Y-strainer between the return connection and the evaporator inlet. The strainer
            basket should be removed and cleaned if necessary. This may be required more often if
            contaminants can easily get into the process water.<br>
            - Have a qualified refrigeration technician inspect the operation of the entire unit to ensure that
            everything
            is operating properly. Have the condenser cleaned out if necessary.<br>

        <center>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                All routine and extraordinary maintenance activities on the machine must be carried out only by
                qualified
                personnel who are familiar with the machine characteristics, operation and maintenance procedures, and
                who
                are aware of the safety requirements and risks involved.
                <br><br>
                The causes of repeated shutdowns deriving from triggering of safety devices must be investigated and
                corrected. Re-starting the unit after simply resetting the alarm can seriously damage the
                equipment.
                <br><br>
                A correct refrigerant is essential for optimal operation of the unit and for environmental protection.
                To protect the environment, do not release refrigerant into the atmosphere. Always use a recovery and
                storage device. Any refrigerant recovery must conform to legislation in force.

            </p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">IMPORTANT</h1>
        <center>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Besides the checks suggested in the routine maintenance program, it is recommended to schedule
                periodical inspections, to be carried out by qualified personnel, as follows:<br>
                4 inspections per year (1 every 3 months) for units running about 365 days per year;
                2 inspections per year (1 at seasonal start-up and the second one in the middle of the season) for units
                running about 180 days per year with seasonal operation.<br>
                1 inspection per year for units that run for a season of approximately 90 days/year (at seasonal
                start-up).<br>

        <h5> Indication & Control:</h5>
        <p>
            Battery Level and Load Level LEDs<br>
            The Battery Level LEDs Show the Voltage Level both in backup mode & in Normal Mode.<br>
            When the LED indicates 20% of the capacity in back-Up mode. It means that the inverter is going to shut
            down.<br>
            For the length of backup of time left. It will depend on the Load. While When All Five LEDs are lighted in
            Normal
            Mode, its mean that the Battery is Fully Charged.<br>
            The load level LEDs show the percentage of added load by the inverters rated capacity. When All Five LEDs
            are
            lighted, The Inverter is over loaded.<br>

            For 10 seconds, and inverter will turn off the power automatically.<br><br>

            - Operation block Diagram is shown below, The Auto-bypass Switch is Available only for 2000VA Or
            above.<br><br>

            - DC Priority Mode/Inverter Mode: There are 2 main operation mode when AC Utility is Normal, The DC Priority
            Mode and the AC Priority Mode. To Set DIP SW3 Up will enable DC Priority Mode. In this mode, DC Power Will
            Be Priority & System Will Draw power from Battery Voltage is normal, System will automatically switch to AC
            Mode and keep the battery at basic charging (24V Or 48V) When Battery Voltage is Low. In the DC Priority
            mode, solar charger and fan generator will be the main Charger Power. The System will not transfer to
            inverter mode until Battery Voltage is charged to 13V for each 12V Battery.<br><br>

            - DC Priority Mode/Green Mode: When Load Level is low (Under 35W), the inverter efficiency is very Low, to
            Save the battery energy, user can enable the green mode (Set DIP SW4 up). The System will Transfer O/P relay
            to bypass mode at low load level. Please turn on the auto by-pass Switch at rear panel under green mode, or
            the output voltage will become Zero when system transfers to bypass mode.<br><br>

        <h1>COMPRESSOR:</h1>
        <h5>Compressor maintenance:</h5>
        <p>
            Instructions relative to inspections and maintenance jobs.<br>
            The table that follows summarizes the periodic and preventative maintenance jobs required to keep the
            compressor in an efficient operational state in time.<br>
            A brief description of the running hours after which the type of maintenance job is required.<br>
            Before performing any jobs within the sound-proof cabinet, ensure that:<br>
            - The main line switch is turned off (position “0”)<br>
            - The electrical compressor switch is Off in position “0”<br>
            - The compressor is disconnected from the compressed air system<br>
            - All the pressure has been released from the compressor and internal pneumatic circuit.<br>
            The front panels are equipped with quick-release locks to facilitate maintenance and any other jobs
            necessary.<br>
            Weekly: it is advisable to inspect the compressor, paying special attention to oil leaks and scale due to
            settled dust and oil.<br>
            Note! If the compressor is used for more than 3000 hours/year the jobs indicated herewith are to be
            performed more often.<br>

        <h1>COOLING TOWER:</h1>
        <h5>Initial and Seasonal Start-Up</h5>
        <p>
            Before initial start-up or after a long shut-down period, the unit should be thoroughly inspected and
            cleaned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turn the fan manually in order to ensure rotation without obstruction.<br>
            Start the fan and check for the proper rotation as indicated by the arrow on the motor.<br>
            Adjust overload fuses to nominal current according to name plate.<br>
            Check current consumption of each phase and compare with indications on motor name plate.<br>
            Once the pump is in operation, check inlet pressure at the water distribution of the cooling tower. In order
            to obtain the guaranteed cooling capacity, the pressure must comply with the required head pressure (see
            name plate/ order confirmation) at the nozzle. Pump to be started against closed valve. The maximum pressure
            must not exceed 0,7 bar, a minimum pressure of 0,2 bar is required for proper function.<br>
            Adjust water level in water collecting basin of cooling tower. Secure make-up water supply. Water regulation
            can be ensured either by a float valve or other devices. Adjust water level, so that suction bend to pump is
            sufficiently covered by water to avoid eddies and consequently the suction of air.<br>
            Furthermore, you should bear in mind that when stopping the pump there is still some water flowing into the
            basin. Therefore, the maximum water level should always be fixed underneath the overflow.<br>
            Adjustment of blow-down.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            (a) Blow-down can be carried out either continuously or in regular intervals by means of a hand valve
            whereby the drained water quantity is manually measured. With small plants, this method is quite
            appropriate.<br>
            (b) With bigger plants, blow-down is generally carried out automatically by means of a conductivity
            measuring unit.<br>
